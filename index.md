# index.md

Welcome to Silly-CMS. This is quite silly, but also kind of neat - in a way.

## Source material is Markdown
[Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is a lot quicker to write than HTML, and it has a lot of features.

For instance, you can create lists:

  - One
  - Two
  - Three
  
  And blockquotes:
  
  > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
  
  Code blocks:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  
  echo "This class needs some CSS"
  
  exit 0
  ```
  
  Etcetera. :)
